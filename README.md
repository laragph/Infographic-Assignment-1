Contextualizing the Impact of the California Wildfires 

By Lara Heard

My project will illustrate the destruction caused by the California wildfires over time, using data by CAL FIRE (https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2021/). The organization provides both the number of structures burned each year and the number of acres. 

2021: 1.968 million acres burned

2020: 4.258 million acres burned

2019: 260k acres burned

2018: 1.975 million acres burned

2017: 1.548 million acres burned

2016: 670k acres burned

2015: 881k acres burned

2014: 626k acres burned

2013: 602k acres burned

I will use tree icons to represent acres burned, with each tree standing for 100k acres. The trees will be laid out in a grid formation (20 tree grid/2 million acres total for each year) and will be shaded according to the appropriate number for each year. To the right of each grid, I will provide an example of a city or landmark of equivalent acreage (e.g., because San Francisco is approximately 30k acres, a city icon could be placed next to the acres burnt grid for 2013 with the explanation that 602k acres is equivalent to approximately 20 San Franciscos). 

Information to accompany the data will include a brief description of the causes of these wildfires, the amount of time it takes to recover burnt land, and scientistsâ€™ projections about the future of the CA climate.
